ASRock Z490M-ITX/ac
===================
My Hardware:
CPU: Intel i5-10400 (with UHD630)
Motherboard: ASRock Z490m-ITX/ax
GPU: AMD RX 580 8GB
WiFi: BCM94352Z

What Works:
- Metal (sorta)
- Apple Store
- Ethernet (intel 1219v)
- Sleep/Wake
- Sound - Headphones (front), Internal Speaker (rear), Microphone (rear)  (via FakePCIID patch kext).
- CPU/GPU identified correctly in System Properties
- WiFi and Bluetooth (BCM94352Z)
- DRM
- Fancy(ish) boot picker (verbose mode is off)
- HWMonitor (CPU and HDD/SSD, GPU is WIP)

What doesn't yet
- Ethernet (2.5Gb)
- Handoff/Continuity


This should be an almost working drop in for anyone with the same config. You'll need to update serials and that good stuff, but this should be most everything to get a system up and running near flawlessly.
